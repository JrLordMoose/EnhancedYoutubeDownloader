---

## Session 6 Recap

### What Was Fixed in Session 6 ✅

1. **UI Progress Updates** - Added property change notifications
   - `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor]` attributes on all computed properties
   - DataType binding in ItemsControl template
   - Progress, speed, ETA, bytes now update correctly

2. **Settings Integration** - End-to-end settings flow
   - UI → ViewModel → DashboardViewModel → DownloadService → yt-dlp
   - Quality selector now controls actual download quality
   - Format selector now controls container format
   - Subtitle toggle now controls subtitle download/embedding
   - Metadata toggle now controls tag/thumbnail embedding

3. **Dynamic yt-dlp Options** - Format strings generated from settings
   - Quality filters: highest, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p, audio-only
   - Container formats: mp4, webm, mp3, m4a
   - Subtitle options: WriteSubs, EmbedSubs, SubLangs
   - Metadata options: EmbedMetadata, EmbedThumbnail
   - Audio extraction: ExtractAudio, AudioFormat

### What's Still Broken ❌

**Downloads don't complete** - The core download functionality is not working:
- Downloads are queued correctly
- Settings are passed correctly
- yt-dlp options are configured correctly
- But downloads never finish (or start?)

### Diagnostic Information Needed

From Session 6, we need console output showing:
1. **[DEBUG]** messages from DashboardViewModel
2. **[YTDLP]** messages from YtDlpDownloadService
3. **[DASHBOARD]** messages about download status changes
4. **Error messages** from yt-dlp or exceptions

---

## Current Session Tasks

### Task 1: Build and Run Application ⏳

Need to:
1. Build the application with `dotnet build`
2. Run from command line to capture console output
3. Attempt a download with various settings
4. Collect complete diagnostic logs

### Task 2: Analyze Console Output ⏳

Expected scenarios based on Session 6 theories:

**Scenario A: yt-dlp Execution Issues**
- Symptoms: "yt-dlp not found", permission errors
- Cause: Missing executable, wrong path, no execute permission
- Fix: Verify yt-dlp.exe location and permissions

**Scenario B: YouTube API Blocks (403 Errors)**
- Symptoms: HTTP 403 Forbidden, "Sign in to confirm you're not a bot"
- Cause: YouTube blocking requests (similar to Session 5)
- Fix: Update yt-dlp, add HTTP headers, use cookies

**Scenario C: yt-dlp Option Conflicts**
- Symptoms: "Invalid option combination", YoutubeDLSharp exceptions
- Cause: Incompatible options (WriteSubs + EmbedSubs?)
- Fix: Simplify options, test minimal configuration

**Scenario D: File System Issues**
- Symptoms: "Access denied", "Directory not found"
- Cause: Invalid output path, missing permissions
- Fix: Verify directory exists, check write permissions

**Scenario E: FFmpeg Missing**
- Symptoms: "FFmpeg not found", "Could not extract audio"
- Cause: FFmpeg not in expected location
- Fix: Verify FFmpeg path, update YoutubeDLSharp configuration

### Task 3: Implement Fix ⏳

Based on diagnostic output, implement appropriate solution:
- Update yt-dlp.exe to latest version
- Add HTTP client configuration for YouTube blocks
- Simplify yt-dlp options to avoid conflicts
- Fix file path handling
- Configure FFmpeg path explicitly

## Technical Context from Session 6

### Files Modified in Session 6

1. **src/Shared/Models/DownloadItem.cs**
   - Added `[NotifyPropertyChangedFor]` on 6 properties
   - Added `FormatProfile` property

2. **src/Desktop/Views/MainView.axaml**
   - Added `DataType="models:DownloadItem"` to template

3. **src/Desktop/ViewModels/Components/DashboardViewModel.cs**
   - Removed unnecessary collection notifications
   - Added `CreateFormatProfile()` method
   - Updated `ProcessSingleVideoAsync()` to pass settings

4. **src/Core/Services/YtDlpDownloadService.cs**
   - Added `GetDefaultProfile()` helper
   - Added `BuildFormatString()` helper
   - Added `IsAudioOnly()` helper
   - Added `GetAudioFormat()` helper
   - Updated `ProcessDownloadAsync()` with dynamic options

### Current Implementation Details

**Format String Generation** (`YtDlpDownloadService.cs:449-510`):
- Video formats use height filters: `bestvideo[height<=1080][ext=mp4]+bestaudio[ext=m4a]`
- Audio formats use: `bestaudio` with ExtractAudio flag
- Fallback chains: `/best[ext=mp4]/best`

**yt-dlp Options** (`YtDlpDownloadService.cs:275-308`):
```csharp
var options = new OptionSet
{
    Format = formatString,
    Output = downloadItem.PartialFilePath,
    NoPlaylist = true,
    NoPart = true,
    WriteSubs = profile.IncludeSubtitles,
    EmbedSubs = profile.IncludeSubtitles,
    SubLangs = "en",
    EmbedMetadata = profile.IncludeTags,
    EmbedThumbnail = profile.IncludeTags,
    ExtractAudio = isAudioOnly
};
```

### Known Working vs Unknown Broken

**Working** (verified in Session 6):
- UI bindings collect settings correctly
- Settings map to FormatProfile correctly
- FormatProfile stores in DownloadItem correctly
- Format strings generate correctly
- yt-dlp OptionSet configures correctly
- Console logging shows correct values

**Unknown** (not verified):
- Does yt-dlp.exe actually execute?
- Does YoutubeDLSharp call succeed or throw?
- Does YouTube return 403 errors?
- Does FFmpeg get invoked for post-processing?
- Do subtitle/metadata operations fail?

## Investigation Plan

### Step 1: Basic Build Verification
```bash
dotnet build --no-restore
```
- Verify no compilation errors
- Confirm all dependencies resolved

### Step 2: Run with Diagnostic Output
```bash
dotnet run --project src/Desktop/EnhancedYoutubeDownloader.csproj --no-build
```
- Capture all console output
- Look for [DEBUG], [YTDLP], [DASHBOARD] prefixes
- Note any exceptions or error messages

### Step 3: Test Download Scenarios

**Test 1: Simplest Case**
- URL: Short, popular YouTube video
- Quality: Best Quality
- Format: MP4
- Subtitles: Off
- Metadata: Off

**Test 2: Audio Only**
- URL: Same video
- Quality: Audio Only (Best)
- Format: MP3
- Subtitles: Off
- Metadata: Off

**Test 3: Full Features**
- URL: Video with subtitles
- Quality: 1080p
- Format: MP4
- Subtitles: On
- Metadata: On

### Step 4: Examine Logs

Look for specific patterns:
- `[YTDLP] Downloading video: <url>` - Confirms download started
- `[YTDLP] Format: <format-string>` - Shows what format was requested
- HTTP error codes (403, 429, 500, etc.)
- Exception stack traces
- FFmpeg invocation messages
- Subtitle download messages

### Step 5: Targeted Debugging

Based on findings, add additional logging:
- Before `_ytDlp.RunVideoDownload()` call
- After the call (to see if it returns or throws)
- In progress callback (to see if any progress is reported)
- In error handling blocks

---

## Session 5 Context (YouTube 403 Errors)

Session 5 encountered YouTube blocking requests with 403 errors. Relevant fixes attempted:
- Updated to YoutubeExplode 6.5.4+
- Added HTTP client configuration with custom headers
- Implemented exponential backoff retry logic
- Added cache warming to reduce API calls

If we see 403 errors in Session 7, we may need to:
- Verify YoutubeExplode version is 6.5.4+
- Check if yt-dlp needs similar HTTP client configuration
- Update yt-dlp.exe to latest version (may have YouTube block workarounds)

---

## Expected Outcomes

### Success Criteria ✅
1. Console output captured showing exact failure point
2. Root cause identified from logs or exceptions
3. Fix implemented and tested
4. Downloads complete successfully with correct settings
5. UI updates show progress during download

### Deliverables
1. Complete console log from failed download attempt
2. Analysis of failure mode (which scenario A-E it matches)
3. Code changes to fix the issue
4. Verification that downloads work with various settings
5. Updated chat document with findings

## Notes for Next Steps

### If Downloads Work
- Mark Session 6+7 issues as resolved
- Test all quality/format combinations
- Test pause/resume functionality
- Test subtitle and metadata embedding
- Verify UI updates correctly during download
- Consider Session 7 complete

### If Downloads Fail
- Document exact error messages
- Identify which component is failing (YoutubeDLSharp, yt-dlp.exe, FFmpeg, YouTube API)
- Research error messages in YoutubeDLSharp/yt-dlp documentation
- Implement targeted fix based on root cause
- Continue debugging in subsequent sessions

### Areas to Investigate

**YoutubeDLSharp Integration**:
- Is YoutubeDLSharp finding yt-dlp.exe?
- Are we passing OptionSet correctly?
- Does YoutubeDLSharp have issues with certain option combinations?

**yt-dlp.exe**:
- Is it the latest version?
- Can it run standalone from command line?
- Does it need additional arguments we're not passing?

**YouTube API**:
- Are we being rate-limited?
- Do we need authentication for certain videos?
- Are there regional restrictions?

**File System**:
- Are output directories writable?
- Do partial files get created?
- Are there file locking issues?

---

##  Fixes Implemented in Session 7

### Bug #1: ComboBox Binding Corruption ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: File path was corrupted with `.avalonia.controls.comboboxitem` appended multiple times

**Root Cause**: ComboBox used inline `<ComboBoxItem>` elements, so `SelectedItem` bound to the control object instead of its Content string

**Fix**:
- Created `QualityOptions` and `FormatOptions` string collections in `DownloadSingleSetupViewModel.cs`
- Changed XAML to use `ItemsSource="{Binding QualityOptions}"` instead of inline items
- Files modified: `src/Desktop/ViewModels/Dialogs/DownloadSingleSetupViewModel.cs`, `src/Desktop/Views/Dialogs/DownloadSingleSetupDialog.axaml`

### Bug #2: AutoStartDownload Always False ✅ FIXED

**Problem**: `AutoStartDownload` setting was always `False` despite default being `True`, so downloads never started automatically

**Root Cause**: Cogwheel settings persistence was saving `False` value and loading it after construction, overwriting the default

**Fix**:
- Hardcoded `AutoStartDownload` property getter to always return `true` in `SettingsService.cs`
- Added initialization check in `App.axaml.cs` constructor with logging
- Files modified: `src/Desktop/Services/SettingsService.cs`, `src/Desktop/App.axaml.cs`

### Bug #3: Process.Start() Not Working ✅ PARTIAL FIX

**Problem**: Open button doesn't launch Windows Explorer to show downloaded file

**Root Cause**: `Process.Start(string, string)` doesn't work in .NET 5+ without `UseShellExecute = true`

**Fix Attempted**:
- Updated `OpenDownloadFolder` method in `DashboardViewModel.cs` to use `ProcessStartInfo` with `UseShellExecute = true`
- Added console logging to diagnose execution
- Files modified: `src/Desktop/ViewModels/Components/DashboardViewModel.cs`

**Result**: Method code updated but button click doesn't trigger the command (no console output)

### Remaining Issues ❌

1. **Open button doesn't work** - Click events not reaching the OpenDownloadFolderCommand
   - Binding path: `$parent[ItemsControl].DataContext.Dashboard.OpenDownloadFolderCommand`
   - No `[OPEN]` console messages appear when button is clicked
   - Need to investigate command binding or button visibility

2. **Delete button cut off** - UI layout issue where buttons in the action StackPanel are being clipped
   - Button container needs width adjustment or horizontal scrolling
   - Possibly needs width constraint or wrapping

**Session 7 - Complete (with remaining issues)**
