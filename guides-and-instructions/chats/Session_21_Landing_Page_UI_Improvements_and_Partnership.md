# Session 21: Landing Page UI Improvements and Partnership Credits

**Date:** October 6, 2025
**Version:** v0.3.9 (no version change, UI improvements only)
**Session Type:** Landing Page Refinements & Branding
**Git Tag:** v1.0.0-savepoint-landing-page-improvements

---

## Session Overview

This session focused on refining the landing page UI/UX based on user feedback, fixing visual inconsistencies, and adding partnership credits. All changes were purely cosmetic and documentation-related with no application code changes.

---

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Download Section Alignment
**Problem:** Download section content (title, description, features) was left-aligned instead of centered.

**Solution:** Added `text-align: center;` to `.download-info` class in `docs/css/style.css`.

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/css/style.css` (lines 1000-1002)

**Result:** All content in the download card now centers horizontally, providing better visual balance.

### 2. Professional Subtitle Burning Card Hover Effect
**Problem:** The "Professional Subtitle Burning" feature card was not showing the same hover effects as other cards:
- No radial glow effect on hover
- Missing standard hover animations
- Card behaved differently from other feature cards

**Root Cause:** The `.feature-card-highlight` class was using `::after` pseudo-element for the "NEW" badge, which overrode the standard `::after` glow effect that all other cards use.

**Solution:**
- Moved "NEW" badge from `.feature-card-highlight::after` to `.feature-card-highlight h3::after`
- This preserved the standard card hover effects while keeping the badge visible
- Badge now positioned relative to the h3 element instead of the card container

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/css/style.css` (lines 627-646)

**Result:** Professional Subtitle Burning card now has:
- ✅ Top gradient line animation on hover (::before)
- ✅ Radial glow effect on hover (::after - restored)
- ✅ Transform with translateY(-8px) and scale(1.02)
- ✅ Enhanced shadow and border color change
- ✅ Icon scale and rotate animation
- ✅ "NEW" badge still visible (on h3::after)

### 3. Partnership Credit Addition
**Problem:** Need to acknowledge Thiink Media Graphics partnership in the footer.

**Solution:** Added partnership credit line to footer-bottom section with clickable link.

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/index.html` (line 384)

**HTML Added:**
```html
<p>In partnership with <a href="https://www.thiinkmediagraphics.com/" target="_blank">Thiink Media Graphics</a></p>
```

**Result:** Footer now displays:
1. Copyright notice
2. Partnership credit (new)
3. Claude Code credit

## Technical Details

### CSS Hover Effect Architecture
The feature cards use a three-layer hover effect system:

1. **::before pseudo-element** - Top gradient line
   - Scales from 0 to full width on hover
   - `transform: scaleX(0)` → `scaleX(1)`

2. **.feature-card:hover** - Container transform
   - `translateY(-8px) scale(1.02)`
   - Enhanced shadow and golden border

3. **::after pseudo-element** - Radial glow
   - Scales from 0 to 1.5 on hover
   - `transform: translate(-50%, -50%) scale(0)` → `scale(1.5)`
   - `opacity: 0` → `1`

The highlighted card was breaking this pattern by using `::after` for the badge, removing the glow effect.

### Solution Architecture
By moving the badge to `h3::after`, we:
- Restored the standard `::after` glow on the card container
- Kept the badge visible (positioned relative to h3)
- Maintained consistent hover behavior across all cards
- Preserved the badge's golden styling and shadow

## Notes

### Design Decisions
- Centered download section for better visual hierarchy
- Kept badge on highlighted card to maintain attention-grabbing design
- Partnership credit placed between copyright and Claude Code credit for appropriate prominence
- Used `target="_blank"` for external partnership link

### Performance Impact
- Minimal - no new animations or effects added
- Only repositioned existing badge element
- No additional HTTP requests

### Maintenance
- If adding more highlighted cards, use same `h3::after` pattern for badges
- Keep standard card hover effects intact by avoiding `::after` override
- Update partnership credits as needed in footer-bottom section
