* Dependency Injection using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection  
* Two-project solution structure:  
  * YoutubeDownloader \- Desktop UI application  
  * YoutubeDownloader.Core \- Reusable business logic library

2\. Application Workflows  
User Interaction Flows:

1. Single Video Download:  
   * User pastes YouTube URL  
   * QueryResolver validates and extracts video metadata  
   * DownloadSingleSetupViewModel dialog shows quality/format options  
   * User selects preferences (quality, container, subtitles, tags)  
   * Download begins with real-time progress tracking

2. Playlist/Channel Download:  
   * User provides playlist or channel URL  
   * System resolves all videos in collection  
   * DownloadMultipleSetupViewModel dialog allows batch configuration  
   * Users can filter videos before download  
   * Parallel downloads managed by ResizableSemaphore (throttling)

3. Search-Based Download:  
   * User enters search keywords  
   * Application queries YouTube and displays results  
   * User selects videos from search results  
   * Proceeds to download configuration

4. Authentication Workflow:  
   * AuthSetupViewModel provides embedded WebView  
   * User logs into Google account  
   * Cookies persist for accessing private/age-restricted content

Data Flow Pipeline:  
URL Input → QueryResolver → Video Metadata → Quality Selection →  
Download Queue → FFmpeg Processing → File Output → Tag Injection →  
Progress Updates → Completion Notification

Background Processing:

* DashboardViewModel orchestrates all active downloads  
* ResizableSemaphore limits concurrent operations  
* Gress library provides progress muxing for multi-stream downloads  
* Real-time status updates via INotifyPropertyChanged and observable collections

3\. Build Process  
Build System Configuration:

* MSBuild with Directory.Build.props for shared settings  
* Multi-project solution with project references  
* Target Framework: net9.0 across all projects  
* Warning as Errors enabled for code quality

Automated Build Steps:

1. FFmpeg Download (Pre-build):  
   * PowerShell script (Download-FFmpeg.ps1) downloads platform-specific FFmpeg  
   * Automatically detects OS/architecture (Windows/Linux/macOS, x64/ARM)  
   * Downloads from GitHub releases (FFmpegBin 7.1.1)  
   * Extracts and copies to project directory  
2. NuGet Restore:  
   * All packages restored from nuget.org  
   * Uses NuGet.config for source configuration  
3. Compilation:  
   * Core library builds first (dependency)  
   * Main UI project references Core  
   * Avalonia XAML compilation with compiled bindings  
4. Output:  
   * Debug/Release configurations  
   * Self-contained deployment option available  
   * Platform-specific runtime identifiers (RID) supported

Development Environment:

* Cross-platform development (VS, VS Code, Rider)  
* Avalonia designer support in Visual Studio  
* Hot reload for XAML changes

4\. Integration and Dependencies  
External Service Integrations:

1. YouTube (via YoutubeExplode):  
   * Direct interaction with YouTube's internal APIs  
   * No official API key required  
   * Extracts video streams, metadata, subtitles, thumbnails  
   * Handles adaptive streaming formats

2. FFmpeg:  
   * Bundled binary (not system-installed)  
   * Muxes video and audio streams  
   * Converts formats (MP4, WebM, MP3, etc.)

   * All I/O operations are async  
   * UI remains responsive during downloads  
   * Proper cancellation token support  
2. Dependency Injection:  
   * Services registered in App.axaml.cs  
   * ViewModels receive dependencies via constructor  
   * Facilitates testing and swapping implementations  
3. Settings Persistence:  
   * Cogwheel library for JSON-based settings  
   * Automatic serialization/deserialization  
   * Type-safe access to settings  
4. Progress Reporting:  
   * Gress library provides consistent progress interface  
   * Supports nested progress (overall \+ individual)  
   * Real-time updates via IProgress\<T\>  
5. Update Mechanism:  
   * Onova provides GitHub release integration  
   * Automatic delta updates when possible  
   * User-controlled update installation

Security Considerations:

* Cookie storage for authentication (local only)  
* No telemetry or tracking by default  
* No user data transmitted to third parties  
* Local-only operation
