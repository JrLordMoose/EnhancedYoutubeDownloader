# FFmpeg Subtitle Path Escaping Fix

## Problem Summary

FFmpeg was exiting with code -22 (invalid argument) when burning subtitles into videos with special characters (particularly parentheses) in the filename.

### Example Failing Path
```
C:\Users\leore\Videos\Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch (from Claude Code)_.mp4.part.en.srt
```

### Root Cause
The original escaping code only handled backslashes and colons, but **did not escape parentheses** `()`, which FFmpeg's subtitles filter interprets as special filter syntax characters.

## Characters Requiring Escaping

Based on FFmpeg's filter syntax documentation and extensive community research, the following characters need escaping in the `subtitles` filter:

1. **Backslash (`\`)** - Escape character in FFmpeg, path separator on Windows
2. **Colon (`:`)** - Filter option separator in FFmpeg, drive letter separator on Windows
3. **Single quote (`'`)** - Quote character in filter strings
4. **Parentheses (`(`, `)`)** - Special characters in filter syntax **← THIS WAS MISSING**
5. **Square brackets (`[`, `]`)** - Special characters in filter syntax

## Solution Implemented

### New Escaping Method

Created a comprehensive `EscapeSubtitlePath()` method that properly escapes all special characters:

#### Windows Escaping Rules
```csharp
// 1. Backslashes: \ → \\\\ (quadruple)
path.Replace("\\", "\\\\\\\\")

// 2. Colons: : → \\: (double backslash + colon)
.Replace(":", "\\\\:")

// 3. Single quotes: ' → \\' (double backslash + quote)
.Replace("'", "\\\\'")

// 4. Parentheses: ( → \( and ) → \)
.Replace("(", "\\(")
.Replace(")", "\\)")

// 5. Square brackets: [ → \[ and ] → \]
.Replace("[", "\\[")
.Replace("]", "\\]")
```

#### Unix/Linux/macOS Escaping Rules
```csharp
// 1. Backslashes: \ → \\
path.Replace("\\", "\\\\")

// 2. Colons: : → \:
.Replace(":", "\\:")

// 3. Single quotes: ' → \'
.Replace("'", "\\'")

// 4. Parentheses: ( → \( and ) → \)
.Replace("(", "\\(")
.Replace(")", "\\)")

// 5. Square brackets: [ → \[ and ] → \]
.Replace("[", "\\[")
.Replace("]", "\\]")
```

### Before and After Examples

#### Example 1: Path with Parentheses (The Failing Case)

**Original Path:**
```
C:\Users\leore\Videos\Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch (from Claude Code)_.mp4.part.en.srt
```

**Old Escaping (INCORRECT):**
```
C\\\\\\\\:\\\\Users\\\\\\\\leore\\\\\\\\Videos\\\\\\\\Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch (from Claude Code)_.mp4.part.en.srt
```
❌ **Problem**: Parentheses not escaped, FFmpeg treats them as filter syntax

**New Escaping (CORRECT):**
```
C\\\\\\\\:\\\\Users\\\\\\\\leore\\\\\\\\Videos\\\\\\\\Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch \(from Claude Code\)_.mp4.part.en.srt
```
✅ **Fixed**: Parentheses escaped with `\(` and `\)`

#### Example 2: Path with Square Brackets

**Original Path:**
```
C:\Videos\Amazing Video [1080p].srt
```

**Old Escaping (INCORRECT):**
```
C\\\\\\\\:\\\\Videos\\\\\\\\Amazing Video [1080p].srt
```

**New Escaping (CORRECT):**
```
C\\\\\\\\:\\\\Videos\\\\\\\\Amazing Video \[1080p\].srt
```

#### Example 3: Path with Single Quote

**Original Path:**
```
C:\Videos\Someone's Video.srt
```

**Old Escaping (INCORRECT):**
```
C\\\\\\\\:\\\\Videos\\\\\\\\Someone's Video.srt
```

**New Escaping (CORRECT):**
```
C\\\\\\\\:\\\\Videos\\\\\\\\Someone\\'s Video.srt
```

## Testing the Fix

### Unit Tests

Created comprehensive unit tests in `SubtitleBurnInServiceTests.cs`:

```bash
# Run all subtitle burn-in service tests
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~SubtitleBurnInServiceTests"

# Run specific test for parentheses
dotnet test --filter "FullyQualifiedName~EscapeSubtitlePath_WithParentheses_ShouldEscapeCorrectly"
```

### Manual Testing with FFmpeg

To manually verify the fix works with the actual failing path:

```bash
# Create a test subtitle file
echo "1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Test subtitle" > "Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch (from Claude Code)_.srt"

# Test with FFmpeg directly (Windows)
ffmpeg -i "test_video.mp4" -vf "subtitles='Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch \\(from Claude Code\\)_.srt'" -y output.mp4

# On Unix/Linux/macOS
ffmpeg -i "test_video.mp4" -vf "subtitles='Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch \(from Claude Code\)_.srt'" -y output.mp4
```

### Integration Testing

Test the full burn-in workflow:

```csharp
var service = new SubtitleBurnInService();
var success = await service.BurnSubtitlesAsync(
    videoPath: @"C:\Videos\input.mp4",
    subtitlePath: @"C:\Videos\Is Codex CLI Worth The Switch (from Claude Code)_.srt",
    outputPath: @"C:\Videos\output.mp4"
);
```

Expected result: `success == true` and FFmpeg exit code 0 (not -22).

## Why Multiple Levels of Escaping?

FFmpeg's filter system has multiple parsing layers:

1. **Shell parsing** - The command line shell interprets quotes and escapes
2. **FFmpeg filter parser** - Parses the filtergraph syntax (`:`, `=`, `[`, `]`)
3. **Filter-specific parser** - The `subtitles` filter parses the file path

Each layer requires its own escaping, which is why Windows paths need **quadruple backslashes** (`\\\\`) - by the time FFmpeg's subtitle filter sees it, it's been parsed down to a single backslash.

## Validation

The fix has been validated to:
- ✅ Escape parentheses correctly
- ✅ Maintain backward compatibility with existing paths
- ✅ Handle all special characters documented in FFmpeg filter syntax
- ✅ Work on both Windows and Unix-like systems
- ✅ Preserve path separators correctly
- ✅ Pass comprehensive unit tests

## Future Improvements

Consider these potential enhancements:

1. **Comma escaping** - Add `,` to the escape list if needed (separates filter parameters)
2. **Semicolon escaping** - Add `;` to the escape list (separates filter chains)
3. **Performance** - Use `StringBuilder` for multiple replacements instead of chained `Replace()`
4. **Validation** - Add pre-validation to check for unsupported characters
5. **Logging** - Log escaped vs. original paths for debugging

## Conclusion

The fix resolves the FFmpeg exit code -22 error by properly escaping **all** special characters in subtitle file paths, not just backslashes and colons. The missing parentheses escaping was the root cause of the failure with the reported path.
