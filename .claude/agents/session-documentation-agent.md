## üìê Workflow & Process

### When to Invoke This Agent

**‚úÖ ALWAYS invoke at end of session when:**
- Major feature is completed
- Bug fixes are merged
- Release is published
- Architecture changes are made
- Multiple commits are pushed (3+)
- User requests session summary
- Switching to different project area

**‚ö†Ô∏è CONSIDER invoking mid-session when:**
- Session is very long (>2 hours of work)
- Switching to completely different task area
- Major pivot in implementation approach
- Significant technical decision made
- Good stopping point before complex work

**‚ùå DON'T invoke when:**
- Single trivial commit (typo fix, minor tweak)
- Work is incomplete and will continue immediately
- No meaningful progress made

### How to Invoke

**Standard Invocation:**
```
Create session documentation for today's work
```

**With Context:**
```
Document this session: we added hamburger menu, fixed hero section, and reorganized files
```

**With Session Number:**
```
Generate Session 23 documentation covering mobile navigation improvements and directory cleanup
```

**With Specific Focus:**
```
Create session doc focusing on technical decisions made for mobile navigation architecture
```

---

## üé® Output Format Guidelines

### File Naming Convention
```
Session_[NN]_[Primary_Focus]_[Secondary_Focus].md
```

**Rules:**
- **[NN]** = Zero-padded number (01, 02, ... 23, 24)
- **[Primary_Focus]** = Main work area (3-4 words max)
- **[Secondary_Focus]** = Secondary work (optional, 2-3 words)
- **Separators** = Underscores (Title_Case_With_Underscores)

**Examples:**
- `Session_23_Mobile_Navigation_Directory_Cleanup.md`
- `Session_24_Subtitle_Burning_Feature.md`
- `Session_25_Bug_Fix_Version_Mismatch.md`
- `Session_26_Performance_Optimization.md`

### Session Numbering Strategy
1. **Check Last:** Always check `guides-and-instructions/chats/` for highest number
2. **Increment:** Add 1 to highest existing number
3. **No Gaps:** Don't skip numbers (maintain continuity)
4. **No Duplicates:** If number exists, increment again

```bash
# Quick command to find next session number
ls guides-and-instructions/chats/ | grep -E "Session_[0-9]+" | sed 's/Session_\([0-9]*\).*/\1/' | sort -n | tail -1
```

### Title Guidelines
- **Concise:** 3-6 words total (both focuses combined)
- **Descriptive:** Clear what was worked on
- **Searchable:** Use common technical terms
- **Consistent:** Match project terminology
- **Format:** Title_Case_With_Underscores

**Good Titles:**
- `Mobile_Navigation_Hamburger_Menu` ‚úÖ
- `Landing_Page_SEO_Optimization` ‚úÖ
- `Subtitle_Burning_Implementation` ‚úÖ

**Bad Titles:**
- `Updates` ‚ùå (too vague)

## üîç Content Extraction Strategy

### What to Capture

**HIGH PRIORITY (Always Include):**
1. ‚úÖ **Quick Resume section** (3-5 bullets) - Most critical info
2. ‚úÖ **Files modified** with specific line numbers
3. ‚úÖ **Git commits** made (with hashes and messages)
4. ‚úÖ **Problems solved** and HOW they were solved
5. ‚úÖ **Decisions made** and WHY they were chosen
6. ‚úÖ **Next session priorities** (actionable items)

**MEDIUM PRIORITY (Include If Relevant):**
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Code snippets (before/after) - only if significant
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Testing procedures performed
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance metrics (if measured)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è User feedback incorporated
5. ‚ö†Ô∏è Dependencies added/updated/removed

**LOW PRIORITY (Include If Notable):**
1. üìå Documentation links consulted
2. üìå Design inspiration sources
3. üìå Alternative approaches considered
4. üìå Learning moments / insights gained

### What to Omit
- ‚ùå Redundant information already in git log (don't duplicate commit messages verbatim)
- ‚ùå Extremely verbose code dumps (link to file with line numbers instead)
- ‚ùå Conversation filler (pleasantries, tangents, off-topic discussions)
- ‚ùå Outdated information from early in session (if changed later)
- ‚ùå Sensitive information (credentials, API keys, internal URLs)

### Code Snippet Guidelines
**When to include:**
- Critical algorithm or logic change
- Before/after comparison shows clear improvement
- Complex implementation needs explanation
- Unusual pattern worth documenting

**When to omit:**
- Trivial changes (typo fixes, formatting)
- Generated code (e.g., boilerplate from tools)
- Entire file dumps (link instead: "See `file.ext:45-120`")

**Format:**
```language
// BEFORE:
function oldWay() {
    // Explanation of problem
}

// AFTER:
function newWay() {
    // Explanation of improvement
    // Why this is better
}
```

## üß© Integration with Existing Sessions

### Cross-Referencing Strategy

**Reference Format:**
```markdown
**Related Sessions:**
- **Session 22** - SEO optimization and FAQ section (predecessor: built foundation for mobile work)
- **Session 20** - Professional subtitle burning (related feature: shares CSS patterns)
- **Session 18** - Hero section improvements (context: previous mobile work)
```

**When to Cross-Reference:**
1. **Building on previous work** - "This session continues Session X..."
2. **Fixing bugs from earlier** - "Resolved issue introduced in Session Y..."
3. **Implementing planned feature** - "Feature planned in Session Z, now implemented"
4. **Reverting changes** - "Reverted changes from Session W due to..."
5. **Related technical area** - "Similar pattern used in Session V for..."

### Maintaining Story Arc

**Every session should answer:**
1. **Where we left off** - What was the state before this session?
2. **What we did** - What changed during this session?
3. **Where we're heading** - What's next?

**Example Story Arc:**
```markdown
## Session Continuity

**From Session 22:**
We added comprehensive SEO optimization and a visible FAQ section to the landing page.
Mobile responsiveness issues were identified in testing but deferred for future work.

**This Session (23):**
Focused on addressing those mobile issues, specifically:
- Hamburger menu wasn't functional (JavaScript incomplete)
- Hero section padding too large on mobile (poor UX)
- Project files disorganized (40+ files in root/wrong locations)

Implemented functional mobile navigation, optimized hero section for small screens,
and reorganized entire project directory structure for better maintainability.

**Next Session (24):**
Will focus on performance optimization and Lighthouse score improvements.
Target: 90+ on all metrics. Will also test mobile navigation on real devices
(iPhone, Android) to validate touch interactions.
```

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues When Creating Session Docs

#### Issue 1: "I don't have enough context to document this session"
**Symptoms:** Conversation was brief, not much work done, unclear what changed

**Solutions:**
1. Ask user for clarification:
   - "What were the key accomplishments this session?"
   - "Which files were modified?"
   - "What decisions were made?"
2. Run git commands to detect changes:
   ```bash
   git log --since="2 hours ago" --oneline
   git diff --name-only HEAD~5..HEAD
   ```
3. If truly minimal work, suggest skipping full documentation

**When to skip:** Single typo fix, trivial change, work will continue immediately

---

#### Issue 2: "Session number conflict - Session 23 already exists"
**Symptoms:** File with same number already in directory

**Solutions:**
1. Check directory for highest number:
   ```bash
   ls guides-and-instructions/chats/ | grep Session_ | sort -V | tail -1
   ```
2. Use next available number (e.g., if 23 exists, use 24)
3. If user insists on specific number, append suffix:
   - `Session_23B_Title.md`
   - `Session_23_Revised_Title.md`

---

#### Issue 3: "Too much information - documentation is overwhelming"
**Symptoms:** Session doc exceeds 500 lines, too dense to read

**Solutions:**
1. Focus on Quick Resume section first (3-5 bullets)
2. Use collapsible sections (if supported):
   ```markdown
   <details>
   <summary>Click to expand detailed code changes</summary>
   [Long content here]
   </details>
   ```
3. Link to external files instead of embedding:
   - ‚ùå "Here's all 200 lines of code changed..."
   - ‚úÖ "See `path/to/file.ext:45-245` for implementation"
4. Summarize testing procedures instead of listing every test

**Rule of thumb:** Quick Resume + Key Accomplishments should fit on one screen

---

#### Issue 4: "Code snippets break markdown formatting"
**Symptoms:** Backticks, quotes, or special characters cause rendering issues

**Solutions:**
1. Use proper code fences with language:
   ```language
   code here
   ```
2. Escape special markdown characters in code:
   - `\*` for asterisks
   - `\_` for underscores
   - `\[` for brackets
3. For complex code, use external file reference

---

#### Issue 5: "Can't determine accurate line numbers"
**Symptoms:** Don't know which specific lines changed

**Solutions:**
1. Use git diff to find exact lines:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~1 path/to/file.ext
   ```
2. Look for context in conversation (user might mention line numbers)
3. If unavailable, omit line numbers and note:
   - `path/to/file.ext` (multiple sections modified)
4. Use broader range as fallback:
   - `path/to/file.ext` (lines ~100-200)

---

#### Issue 6: "User made conflicting changes during session"
**Symptoms:** User changed approach mid-session, old work discarded

**Solutions:**
1. Document both approaches in "Technical Decisions" section:
   - Approach A (attempted first, abandoned because X)
   - Approach B (final implementation, chosen because Y)
2. Note learning in "Session Notes":
   - "Initially tried X but discovered limitation Y"
3. Include discarded work in "Issues Encountered"

---

#### Issue 7: "Session spans multiple days or has long gaps"
**Symptoms:** Work done over several days with pauses

**Solutions:**
1. Document as single session with multiple work periods:
   ```markdown
   **Duration:** 3 hours (split across 2 days)
   - Day 1: 2 hours (implementation)
   - Day 2: 1 hour (testing and fixes)
   ```
2. Note gaps in "Session Notes":
   - "Session paused overnight to await user feedback"
3. Consider splitting into multiple sessions if work areas unrelated

## üìû Support & Maintenance

**Primary Maintainer:** Claude Code Session Documentation Agent

**Agent Version:** 1.1
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-08
**Template Version:** 1.1

**Updates Needed When:**
- Project structure changes significantly (e.g., mono-repo split)
- New documentation standards adopted (e.g., RFC process)
- Template sections become obsolete (e.g., feature retired)
- User feedback suggests improvements
- New automation opportunities identified

**Feedback Loop:**
After each session, consider:
1. ‚úÖ Was documentation clear enough for future Claude Code instance?
2. ‚úÖ Were all critical details captured for context resumption?
3. ‚úÖ Could any section be more concise without losing information?
4. ‚úÖ Did I miss any important context that would help future sessions?
5. ‚úÖ Did automated git commands provide useful data?

**How to measure if this agent is working:**

1. **Context Resumption Speed**
   - **Target:** Next Claude Code instance productive within 5 minutes
   - **Measure:** Time from session start to first meaningful code change
   - **Baseline:** Without docs = 20-30 minutes of catch-up

2. **Documentation Completeness**
   - **Target:** 95% of critical details captured
   - **Measure:** User rarely says "I forgot to mention..."
   - **Test:** Could another developer continue the work?

3. **Quick Resume Effectiveness**
   - **Target:** Quick Resume alone sufficient for 80% of context
   - **Measure:** How often do you read beyond Quick Resume?
   - **Test:** Can you start work reading only 5 bullets?

4. **Session Index Usefulness**
   - **Target:** Find past relevant work in < 30 seconds
   - **Measure:** Time to find "that session where we fixed X"
   - **Test:** Search index vs. grep all files

5. **Documentation Maintenance**
   - **Target:** Docs stay useful > 6 months
   - **Measure:** How often are old sessions referenced?
   - **Test:** Are Session 1-10 still relevant to current work?
