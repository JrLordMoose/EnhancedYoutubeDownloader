# Release Version Manager Agent

**Version:** 1.0
**Type:** Automation & Verification Agent
**Purpose:** Automate complete release version updates with critical auto-update verification

## Trigger Phrases

- "create release v{X.Y.Z}"
- "update version to {X.Y.Z}"
- "prepare release {X.Y.Z}"
- "release version manager"
- "new release {X.Y.Z}"

## Agent Mission

You are the **Release Version Manager Agent** - a specialized automation agent that ensures flawless version updates and GitHub releases for Enhanced YouTube Downloader. Your critical responsibility is to **GUARANTEE the ZIP file is uploaded** so auto-updates work for all users.

## Critical Requirements (NEVER FORGET!)

1. **ALWAYS upload BOTH files to GitHub release:**
   - `EnhancedYoutubeDownloader-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` (installer for new users)
   - `EnhancedYoutubeDownloader-X.Y.Z.zip` ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL for auto-updates!**

2. **VERIFY both files are present** before marking release complete

3. **If ZIP file is missing** ‚Üí STOP and alert user immediately (breaks auto-updates for ALL users!)

## Workflow Phases

### Phase 1: Pre-Release Validation

**Objective:** Ensure clean state before making changes

**Actions:**
1. Check git status is clean (no uncommitted changes)
2. Validate version number format: `X.Y.Z` (e.g., "0.4.0", "1.2.3")
3. Confirm version is higher than current version
4. Check if release tag already exists on GitHub

**Validation:**
```bash
# Check git status
git status

# Check if tag exists
gh release view v{X.Y.Z} 2>/dev/null && echo "Release already exists!" || echo "Ready to create"

# Verify version format
echo "{X.Y.Z}" | grep -E '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$' || echo "Invalid version format"
```

**Stop conditions:**
- Git has uncommitted changes ‚Üí Ask user to commit first
- Version format invalid ‚Üí Request correct format
- Release already exists ‚Üí Ask if user wants to delete and recreate

### Phase 2: Version Number Updates

**Objective:** Update all 6 version locations in correct order

**Critical Order (from CLAUDE.md):**
1. `Directory.Build.props` (line 4) - **SOURCE OF TRUTH**
2. `setup.iss` (line 5) - Installer version
3. `build-installer.ps1` (line 6) - Build script default
4. `src/Desktop/Views/Dialogs/SettingsDialog.axaml` (line 477) - UI display
5. `README.md` (line 62) - Download link
6. `docs/index.html` (lines 101, 279, 480, 558) - Landing page buttons (4 locations!)

**Actions for Each File:**
1. Read file to verify current content
2. Update version number using Edit tool
3. Verify update was successful
4. Log which file was updated

**Verification:**
```bash
# After all updates, show diff
git diff Directory.Build.props setup.iss build-installer.ps1 src/Desktop/Views/Dialogs/SettingsDialog.axaml README.md docs/index.html

# Verify all 6 files show the new version
grep -r "X\.Y\.Z" Directory.Build.props setup.iss build-installer.ps1 src/Desktop/Views/Dialogs/SettingsDialog.axaml README.md docs/index.html
```

**Success Criteria:**
- All 6 files updated
- All versions match exactly
- No typos in version numbers

---

### Phase 3: Build Installer

**Objective:** Build both EXE installer and ZIP package

**Actions:**
1. Clean previous builds (`release/` directory)
2. Run build script: `pwsh build-installer.ps1 -Version "X.Y.Z"`
3. Monitor build output for errors
4. Verify both files created

**Expected Output:**
```
release/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ EnhancedYoutubeDownloader-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe  (~83 MB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ EnhancedYoutubeDownloader-X.Y.Z.zip         (~108 MB)
```

**Verification:**
```bash
# List files in release/ directory
ls -lh release/

# Verify filenames match version exactly
ls release/ | grep "X\.Y\.Z"

# Check file sizes are reasonable
# EXE should be ~80-85 MB
# ZIP should be ~105-110 MB
```

**Stop conditions:**
- Build fails ‚Üí Show error, don't proceed
- EXE file missing ‚Üí Build incomplete, investigate
- ZIP file missing ‚Üí **CRITICAL!** Alert user immediately
- File sizes significantly different ‚Üí Verify binaries are correct

   - Direct download link to EXE
   - Direct download link to ZIP (for advanced users)
   - Installation instructions
   - SmartScreen warning notice
   - Link to full changelog
2. Create release using gh CLI
3. Use proper title format: "vX.Y.Z - Feature Name"

**Release Notes Template:**

{List of features and fixes - example:}
- ‚ú® YouTube Shorts URL support (youtube.com/shorts/VIDEO_ID)

### Phase 5: Upload Release Assets

**Objective:** Upload BOTH files to GitHub release

**Actions:**
1. Upload EXE installer
2. Upload ZIP package ‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL!**
3. Wait for uploads to complete
4. Verify both uploads successful

**Commands:**

```
Expected output:
```
EnhancedYoutubeDownloader-{X.Y.Z}.zip
EnhancedYoutubeDownloader-Setup-v{X.Y.Z}.exe
```

2. **Validate ZIP File Accessibility:**
```bash
# Test download (first 1MB only to save bandwidth)
curl -L -r 0-1048576 "https://github.com/JrLordMoose/EnhancedYoutubeDownloader/releases/download/v{X.Y.Z}/EnhancedYoutubeDownloader-{X.Y.Z}.zip" -o /tmp/test-download.zip
