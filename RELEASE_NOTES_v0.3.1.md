# Enhanced YouTube Downloader v0.3.1 - Critical Bug Fix Release

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL FIX - Downloads Now Working!

**If you downloaded v0.3.0 (or the initial v1.0.0 installer), please update to v0.3.1 immediately.**

### What Was Fixed
- **Issue**: All downloads failed immediately after installation with "Failed" status
- **Root Cause**: FFmpeg was missing from the installer package
- **Impact**: Application was completely non-functional for downloading videos
- **Fix**: FFmpeg (518KB) is now properly bundled in the installer

### Symptoms of the Bug
- Downloads would immediately fail with no error message
- Restart button did not work
- No videos could be downloaded regardless of source

### Why This Happened
During the build process, the FFmpeg download target in the project file was accidentally commented out, causing the installer to be built without the critical FFmpeg binary required for video conversion.
